# InfoVault Service
Secure access and management of personal information. 

## Opportunities
1M5 is designed for end users in a peer-to-peer network targeting open source
personal mobiles/tablets/laptops/desktops with the number of network nodes in the
billions. To support decentralized applications that can use this platform, 
a graph database is desired due the large number of nodes likely to be traversed
while supporting ACID properties yet with a tunable consistency. JanusGraph and
Cassandra are being used as inspiration but in a P2P model that can work in mobiles
over 1M5's anonymous networks such as I2P and Tor.
