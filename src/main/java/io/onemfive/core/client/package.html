    Classes implementing the SCClient interface will be controlled with
    that interface instead of being started with main().
</p>
<p>
    The benefits for clients using this interface:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get the current context via the constructor</li>
    <li>Complete life cycle management by the core</li>
    <li>Avoid the need for static references</li>
    <li>Ability to find other clients without using static references</li>
</ul>
