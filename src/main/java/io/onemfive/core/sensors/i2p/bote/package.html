Contains a copy of I2P Bote codebase. This was done due to I2P bote, as of May 2018, not providing a library
in a Maven repository and inability to get the project to build as it was reliant on downloading I2P.I2P
and getting it to build which the author was unable to accomplish.

I2P Bote is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
</p>
<p>
The copy of code in this package was copied class-by-class and with the hopes of no modifications to ensure ease
of upgrading later.
</p>
<p>
If modifications are made, please note them in this file to ensure they can be noted for re-modification with
future upgrades from I2P.
